 $E = A * r * H * PR$

    * E is energy (kWh),
    * A is the solar panel area (m2)
    * r is panel yield (0-1) (manufacture efficiency - usually around 0.2),
    * PR is performance ratio (0-1) (accounting for site factors that impact efficiency usually around 0.75) 
    * H is annual average solar radiation (kWh)

```{r}
# Function
energy <- function(A, H) {
  E <- A * 0.2 * H * 0.75
  print(E)
  }
```
